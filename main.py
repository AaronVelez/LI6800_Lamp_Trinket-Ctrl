# Code for temperature control of LI6800 custum LED lamp

# Details:
# Runs in an Arduino-compatible Trinket board with an ARM Cortex M0+ processor
# It measures LED temperature using a thermistor
# It controls a 4-wire fan via a 25kHz PWM signal
# PWM duty cycle is set by a PID algorithm to control LED temperaure
# Temperature setpoint is encoded in an analog signal from LI6800 console
# Fan speed is read from fan tachometer
# Fan speed is encoded in an analog singal and sent to LI6800
